### Here is the quiz:

**REMINDER:** Write your answers directly under each question. No one-liners, please.
Use Google to find answers, but make sure to use your own words to answer the questions.
**Be as explicit as possible**

1. Please explain semantic versioning.
> Your answer: Semantic versioning is how projects communicate what kind of changes are in the newest release. Sometimes the changes break the code based on new changes, so it's important to be clear about what has changed.

2. What's the Difference between Client vs Server Side Development?
> Your answer:
Server side development - code that runs on the computer, ie the code is always running on the server and not on the user's computer.
Client side development - code that runs on the client's computer, ie code that the user triggers when they open a webpage and can be run in the browser, like javascript

3. What is Node.js? How does it differ from browser-based javascript?
> Your answer:
Node.js is a platform that was built on Chrome's Javascript runtime that makes it easy to build and manipulate fast and scalable network applications. It is event driven and non blocking, which makes it ideal for data intense websites.

4. Name some other competing server-side languages/technologies besides Node.js.
> Your answer:
Ruby on Rails
ASP.NET
Django
Express.js & KOA

5. Is Javascript and NodeJS asynchronous? Explain your answer
> Your answer:
Both are asynchronous. They are both event driven and have non blocking code, which means they don't depend on other functions, and they don't stop and wait for other lines of code before processing. 

6. What is a module? Why do we use modules? How do you include a module in your application?
> Your answer:
Modules are a set of functions you want to include in your application. We use modules so that it's easier to troubleshoot and modify code because things are compartmentalized. We can put different modules in different js files as "helper functions" so when something breaks, we can immediately target where the problem in. 

7. What is npm? How do we use npm to get key components for our node applications? What is package.json?
> Your answer:
NPM is a node package manager for Node.js packages. We use npm components to access a registry, which is an online database, of public and private packages. Package.json tells the user what they need to know about the package.json file - included in the file is the name and version fields.

**BONUS**

What language(s) is the underlying code for node.js written in?
C, C++ and Javascript
